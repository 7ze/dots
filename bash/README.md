# Bash

```custom
    ~
    ├── .bashrc         loads aliases, custom functions, etc for the interactive shell
    └── .profile        sets up environment variables
```

## Install notes

- Depends on [shell](/shell/) for the environment variables, aliases, functions
and customized prompt
- Depends on [starship](https://starship.rs) for the prompt
